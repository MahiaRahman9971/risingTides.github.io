                    Narges Mahyar is an assistant professor at the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences,
                    University of Massachusetts Amherst. Currently, she is a Radcliffe fellow at Harvard University. Narges
                    specializes in a multidisciplinary research area that spans human-computer interaction,
                    information visualization, social computing, applied machine learning, human-centered artificial intelligence,
                    and design. She applies a community-centered design approach to build novel social computing and visualization
                    tools to empower the general public to engage in real-world sociotechnical issues, such as urban planning and
                    climate change, by enabling them to share their ideas and comments for shaping future policies. During her
                    Radcliffe fellowship, she is investigating innovative techniques to integrate situated visualization, augmented
                    reality, and civic technology to design and build an accessible platform that simulates the localized impact
                    of climate change, thereby providing Boston residents with an immersive experience of climate change
                    visualizations and empowering them to contribute comments and ideas on climate change issues.</p>
