                Jasai Martinez is a sophomore studying Computer Science and Statistics. He is currently a Radcliffe
                Research Partner at Harvard University, where he eagerly contributes his skills and dedication to the
                RisingTides project. The pressing issues of climate change have hit close to home for Jasai, particularly
                during the California wildfires that affected his community. His commitment to addressing these climate
                challenges led him to join the RisingTides project, which focuses on leveraging accessible technology to
                engage and empower communities in the fight against climate change. He is dedicated to raising awareness
                of the unique flooding challenges faced by communities like East Boston and aspires to empower residents
                by fostering a sense of agency in addressing these critical issues and working toward meaningful solutions.
                Jasai is excited to collaborate with his fellow research partners and learn from the guidance of Professor
                Narges. Together with his peers, he looks forward to harnessing accessible technology and data-driven
                insights to make a lasting impact on climate change awareness and resilience efforts, with a particular
                focus on East Boston's specific needs and challenges.</p>
